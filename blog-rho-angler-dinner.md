# Hooked on Connections: My Night at the Rho-Sponsored Angler Dinner

Last Thursday evening, I found myself at one of the most unique networking events I've attended in a while – an angler dinner sponsored by Rho, the business banking platform. What started as a casual RSVP turned into an evening filled with fascinating conversations, fresh perspectives, and some seriously good seafood.

## The Unlikely Intersection of Fishing and Finance

When I first received the invite, I'll admit I was intrigued by the concept. A dinner bringing together fishing enthusiasts and tech entrepreneurs? Sponsored by a fintech company? It seemed like an unusual combination, but that's exactly what made it compelling. Rho, known for helping startups and growing companies manage their finances, had clearly thought outside the box with this one.

The venue was perfect – a waterfront restaurant with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the harbor. As the sun set, casting golden reflections on the water, you could almost feel the connection between the patience required for both fishing and building a successful business.

## Meeting the Catch of the Day (People, Not Fish)

What made the evening truly special were the people I met. Here are a few standouts:

### Marcus - The Serial Entrepreneur Turned Fly-Fishing Guide

Marcus had sold two startups before deciding to pursue his passion for fly-fishing full-time. Now he runs guided tours in Montana while consulting for tech companies on the side. His perspective on finding balance and knowing when to "reel in" a business venture versus when to "catch and release" was pure gold. We spent a good hour discussing how the meditative aspects of fishing parallel the focus needed for deep work in coding.

### Sarah - The Marine Biologist Building Ocean Tech

Sarah is developing IoT sensors for sustainable fishing practices. Her startup tracks fish populations in real-time, helping commercial fishers avoid overfished areas. The way she bridged environmental conservation with practical business needs was inspiring. She mentioned how Rho's expense management tools had been crucial for tracking their field research costs across multiple coastal sites.

### The Chen Brothers - Running a D2C Fishing Gear Startup

These two left corporate jobs at major outdoor retailers to start their own direct-to-consumer fishing gear company. They're using advanced materials from aerospace engineering to create ultra-light, ultra-strong fishing rods. Their enthusiasm was infectious, and they had some great insights about supply chain management and working with manufacturers overseas.

### Alex - The VC Who Only Takes Meetings on Boats

Perhaps the most interesting character of the night, Alex literally conducts all their first meetings with founders while fishing. "You learn more about someone in three hours on a boat than in ten boardroom meetings," they said. Hard to argue with that logic, especially after hearing about some of the successful investments that came from those nautical negotiations.

## The Rho Connection

Throughout the evening, the Rho team was present but not pushy – exactly the right approach for this crowd. They shared some interesting insights about how many of their clients are in the outdoor and recreational industries, dealing with seasonal cash flows and complex inventory management.

What resonated most was their understanding that modern businesses, especially those bridging traditional industries with tech innovation, need banking tools that can keep up with their unique challenges. One founder mentioned how Rho's API-first approach let them automate expense tracking for guide payments across multiple states – a nightmare with traditional banks.

## Lessons Learned Between Courses

As we moved from oysters to mains (I had the blackened salmon, naturally), several themes kept surfacing in conversations:

1. **Patience Pays Off**: Whether you're waiting for a bite or waiting for product-market fit, the ability to stay calm and persistent is crucial.

2. **Read the Conditions**: Just as anglers read water conditions and weather patterns, successful entrepreneurs need to constantly read market conditions and adapt their strategies.

3. **The Right Tools Matter**: Having proper gear can make the difference between success and failure, whether that's a quality rod or a modern banking platform that doesn't slow you down.

4. **Catch and Release**: Sometimes the best move is to let an opportunity go, knowing there will be others. This applies to business decisions, hiring, and even feature development.

5. **The Early Bird Gets the Fish**: Several founders talked about the importance of early morning productivity – apparently, there's significant overlap between people who code at 5 AM and people who fish at dawn.

## Reeling It In

As the evening wound down and we shared contact information (yes, there were several "let's go fishing sometime" invitations extended), I realized this was exactly the kind of event our industry needs more of. Not another generic mixer with warm beer and elevator pitches, but thoughtful gatherings that bring together people with shared interests beyond just "doing business."

The Rho team deserves credit for understanding that the best professional relationships often start with personal connections. By bringing together people who share a passion for fishing – whether they're coding apps, managing supply chains, or investing in startups – they created an environment where genuine conversations could flourish.

I left with a handful of new connections, some promising collaboration ideas, and a strong desire to dust off my own fishing gear. Sometimes the best networking happens when you're not trying to network at all – you're just sharing stories about the one that got away.

## The Tide Comes In

If you get a chance to attend one of these unconventional industry events, take it. You never know who you'll meet or what insights you'll gain when you step outside the usual conference circuit. And if anyone wants to discuss API architecture or startup challenges over some early morning fishing, you know where to find me – probably trying to debug my code while simultaneously untangling my fishing line.

Special thanks to the Rho team for hosting and for understanding that sometimes the best way to talk about business is not to talk about business at all.
