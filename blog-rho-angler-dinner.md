# An Evening at Angler: Where Finance Meets Fine Dining

Last night, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate dinner at Angler, graciously hosted by Rho. For those unfamiliar, Angler is the Michelin-starred seafood-focused restaurant perched atop the Embarcadero, with sweeping views of the Bay Bridge that make the already exceptional food taste even better.

## The Setting

Walking into Angler feels like entering a warm, modern lodge—all exposed wood beams and open-fire cooking. The private dining room Rho had reserved offered panoramic views of the Bay, with the bridge lights creating a stunning backdrop as the sun set. It was the perfect atmosphere for meaningful conversations about the future of finance and technology.

## The Connections

What made the evening truly special wasn't just the perfectly grilled whole fish or the wine pairings (though both were exceptional). It was the caliber of people Rho had brought together. Around the table were:

- **Sarah Chen**, founder of a YC-backed fintech startup that's reimagining corporate expense management
- **Marcus Rodriguez**, former Stripe engineer who's now building infrastructure for instant B2B payments
- **Alex Kumar**, a CFO who recently took their company public and had fascinating insights on modern financial operations
- **Jamie Park**, a venture partner at a prominent seed fund focused on financial infrastructure

The conversations flowed as smoothly as the wine, ranging from the technical challenges of real-time money movement to the human side of building financial products that people actually want to use.

## The Rho Perspective

What impressed me most about Rho's approach wasn't just their product (though their banking and spend management platform is genuinely innovative). It was their genuine interest in fostering community among builders in the finance space. Their team didn't dominate the conversation with sales pitches—instead, they asked thoughtful questions and shared real insights from working with hundreds of growing companies.

Their VP of Product shared a fascinating perspective: "We see finance tools not as constraints, but as enablers. When you remove friction from financial operations, companies can move faster and focus on what matters—building great products."

## Key Takeaways

Several themes emerged from our discussions that I'm still thinking about:

1. **The convergence of fintech and traditional finance is accelerating.** The lines between "tech companies" and "financial services" are increasingly blurred.

2. **API-first is no longer optional.** Every financial tool needs to play well with others in an increasingly complex stack.

3. **The next generation of CFOs are technologists.** They're not just managing books—they're building systems and thinking about data architecture.

4. **Community matters in B2B.** The most successful companies aren't just selling products; they're building ecosystems and bringing their customers together.

## The Food (Because It Deserves a Mention)

Chef Joshua Skenes' philosophy of cooking over open fire was on full display. The meal started with fresh oysters that tasted like the ocean itself, followed by a whole turbot that had been kissed by smoke and flame. The vegetable sides—particularly the roasted carrots with harissa—were revelations. And the sourdough ice cream for dessert? Pure genius.

## Looking Forward

As I took a Lyft home across the Bay Bridge—the same bridge I'd been admiring through dinner—I reflected on how these kinds of gatherings are what make the Bay Area tech scene special. It's not just about the deals or the networking. It's about passionate people coming together to share ideas and push each other forward.

Thanks to Rho for bringing together such an inspiring group and for choosing such an incredible venue to do it. If this is how they approach partnership and community building, I'm excited to see what they do next.
