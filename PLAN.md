working back from a demo:

- linear interface for main thing
- launch 1: “vercel preview environments”
  - vercel comments pill that pipes directly to claude code
- launch 2: after all coding clis are done running, we spin up operator to test the changes and take screenshots to make it easy to verify stuff
  - launch 3: swift app
- code review
  - swipe left or swipe right (order of changes)..
  - merge queue...?
