today we're launching cmux

it's basically Linear for Claude Code

we made Linear for Claude Code

cmux is an open source coding CLI manager that spawns Claude Code, Cursor CLI, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Amp, Opencode, and other coding agent CLIs in parallel across multiple tasks

=========

there's too many terminal coding agents...

so we build cmux: it's like tmux for Claude Code
cmux lets you run every single coding CLI in parallel across multiple tasks
this means you don't have to choose between Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Amp, Opencode, ...
instead, you can run them all at the same time and guarantee sota coding performance today
