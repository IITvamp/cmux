# Rho-Sponsored Angler Dinner: Where Finance Meets Fly Fishing

*September 28, 2025*

Last night, I had the incredible opportunity to attend an angler dinner sponsored by Rho, and what an evening it turned out to be. The intersection of finance tech and fly fishing might seem unlikely at first, but as I discovered, there's a surprising overlap between people who appreciate precision in both their professional tools and their recreational pursuits.

## The Setting

The event was held at a beautiful waterfront venue, with the golden hour light casting perfect reflections on the water as guests arrived. Rho had clearly put thought into every detail - from the locally-sourced seafood menu to the vintage fishing gear displays that sparked conversations throughout the night.

## Meeting Fascinating People

What struck me most was the diversity of backgrounds among attendees. I found myself in conversations with:

- **Sarah**, a CFO who started fly fishing during the pandemic and now organizes quarterly fishing retreats for her finance team as a way to decompress and strategize away from screens
- **Marcus**, a venture capitalist who draws parallels between reading water conditions and reading market trends - "Both require patience, observation, and knowing when to cast your line," he said
- **Elena**, a fintech founder who uses fishing metaphors in her pitch decks and swears it helps investors understand complex financial products better
- **Tom**, a retired investment banker turned fishing guide who shared stories about taking stressed executives out on the water and watching their perspectives shift

## The Rho Connection

The folks from Rho were excellent hosts, and I was impressed by how they've built a community around more than just their banking platform. Their team genuinely understands that finance leaders need spaces to connect beyond spreadsheets and dashboards. They've identified fishing as one of those rare activities that combines strategy, patience, and mindfulness - qualities essential in both financial management and angling.

During dinner, Rho's head of community mentioned they're planning a series of these dinners across different cities, each focusing on bringing together finance professionals who share outdoor passions. It's a refreshing approach to B2B relationship building.

## Unexpected Insights

The conversation that stuck with me most was with David, a controller at a fast-growing startup. He explained how fishing taught him about sustainable growth: "You can't just take every fish from the stream. You need to think about the ecosystem, practice catch and release, and ensure there's something left for tomorrow. Same with company finances - it's not about maximizing every quarter, but building something that lasts."

## Technical Talk Meets Tackle Talk

Perhaps the most entertaining part of the evening was watching people seamlessly transition from discussing API integrations and automated reconciliation to debating the merits of different fly patterns and rod weights. One moment we're talking about real-time financial data, the next about reading river currents in real-time.

## Looking Forward

As the evening wound down, I exchanged contact information with several new connections. We're already planning a group fishing trip next month, and there's talk of starting a "Fintech Anglers" Slack community.

Events like these remind me that the best professional connections often happen when we step away from pure networking and bond over shared passions. Rho has tapped into something special here - creating authentic community moments that happen to be sponsored by a financial platform, rather than forced corporate mingling with a thin veneer of interest.

## Final Thoughts

Walking away from the dinner, I felt energized not just by the new connections, but by the reminder that successful professionals are multidimensional. The same analytical minds that optimize cash flow can find joy in matching the hatch on a trout stream. The patience required to land a permit on a fly rod translates beautifully to navigating complex financial negotiations.

Thanks to Rho for hosting such a thoughtful event. In a world of virtual everything, gathering in person around a shared passion - with great food and even better conversation - feels like exactly what our community needs.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go tie some flies for next weekend's trip with my new angler friends.
