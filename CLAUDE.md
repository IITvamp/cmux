This project is called cmux. cmux is a web app that spawns Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Amp, Opencode, and other coding agent CLIs in parallel across multiple tasks. For each run, cmux spawns an isolated openvscode instance via Docker or a configurable sandbox provider. The openvscode instance by default opens the git diff UI and a terminal with the running dev server (configurable via devcontainer.json).

# Config

Use pnpm to install dependencies and run the project.
`./scripts/dev.sh` will start the project. Optional flags:

- `--force-docker-build`: Rebuild worker image even if cached.
- `--show-compose-logs`: Also stream Docker Compose logs to the console (they are always written to `logs/docker-compose.log`). Docker build logs are always shown.
  After finishing a task, run `bun run typecheck` in root to typecheck everything. You should always cd to root and run this command; do not manually run tsc any other way.

# Backend

This project uses Convex.
Schemas are defined in packages/convex/convex/schema.ts.
Do not use Convex actions. Instead, use the socket.io server with custom events.

# Frontend

This project uses React, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.
Always use tailwind `neutral` instead of `gray` for gray colors.
Always support dark mode.

# Misc

Always use node: prefixes for node imports.
Do not use the any type.
Don't modify README.md unless explicitly asked.

## Logs

When running `./scripts/dev.sh`, service logs are written to `logs/{type}.log`:

- docker-compose.log: Output from `.devcontainer` Docker Compose stack. Hidden from console by default; use `--show-compose-logs` to stream.
- convex-dev.log: Convex development server (`bunx convex dev`).
- server.log: Backend dev server in `apps/server`.
- client.log: Frontend dev server in `apps/client` (Vite).

Log files are overwritten on each run. Use `tail -f logs/<file>` to follow live output.
