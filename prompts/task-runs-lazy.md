make loading taskRuns lazy. always show the expand button, but if there's no task runs yet, and user opens it, we can say no task runs yet
prefetch on hover
make sure to bring the query down a component, create a new component if necessary
use the convexQueryClient.convexClient.prewarmQuery function, heres an example:
convexQueryClient.convexClient.prewarmQuery({
query: api.github_prs.listPullRequests,
args: { teamSlugOrId, state: "open", search: "" },
});

do not use useEffect

also we need to modify schema.ts tasks such that we store the autogenerated branch name so we don't need to derive it from the child taskRuns.
