Create socketio event on server that lets me start tasks. this must be called when user presses "start task" on frontend. then get rid of setupWorkspace in @src/routes/\_layout.dashboard.tsx as well as setupProjectWorkspace in @convex/gitActions.ts. goal is to convert the setupProjectWorkspace from being a convex action to just being a normal node function that gets called from the socketio server. the socketio server should then be responsible for calling the relevant convex mutations/queries. the socketio event handler needs to spawn a claude session with the command `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions $PROMPT` with the right prompt environment variable from the frontend. the claude session should be started in parallel with the relevant convex mutation. the command must be spawned in a new terminal thing. there's some code inside the create-terminal for creating new terminals that should be extracted and reused.
