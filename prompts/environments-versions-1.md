we're implementing environments rn, apps/client/src/components/EnvironmentConfiguration.tsx apps/www/lib/routes/environments.route.ts explore and find environmentdetails too -- make it so that when we click "New snapshot version" in the environment details page, it will take us to the same UI as when we click "New environment" in the environments page. so we need to make the "New environment" page generalizable to be used for both cases. we need to pre-populate the form with the existing environment's data. we need to also create a new instance from the latest snapshot and have it render as the vscode in the right hand side of the configure environment page
