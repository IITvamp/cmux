# An Evening at Angler: Where Finance Meets Innovation

Last night, I had the privilege of attending an intimate dinner at Angler, the Michelin-starred restaurant perched atop the South Place Hotel in London, courtesy of our friends at Rho. What started as a simple networking event turned into one of those rare evenings where genuine connections form over exceptional food and even better conversation.

## The Setting

If you haven't been to Angler, imagine floor-to-ceiling windows offering panoramic views of London's skyline as the sun sets, transforming the city into a glittering tapestry of lights. The restaurant's sophisticated yet unpretentious atmosphere set the perfect tone for what would become an evening of meaningful exchanges between founders, engineers, and finance innovators.

## The Catalyst: Rho's Vision

Rho, for those unfamiliar, is revolutionizing how businesses handle their finances – think of them as the modern CFO's Swiss Army knife. Their sponsorship of the evening wasn't just about showcasing their platform (though their demo was genuinely impressive). It was about bringing together people who are building the future of technology and finance.

What struck me most was Rho's genuine interest in understanding the pain points we face as builders. Rather than a typical vendor pitch, the evening felt like a collaborative discussion about how financial infrastructure should evolve to support modern businesses.

## The Connections

The real magic happened in the conversations between courses. I found myself seated next to:

- **Sarah**, a serial entrepreneur who just exited her third startup and is now angel investing in climate tech. Her perspective on due diligence completely changed how I think about investor relations.

- **Marcus**, a former Goldman Sachs quant who's building an AI-powered treasury management system. We geeked out over API design patterns for financial services – surprisingly riveting dinner conversation!

- **Priya**, who runs product at a Series B fintech. Our discussion about user onboarding flows lasted through two courses and resulted in three pages of napkin sketches.

- **James**, Rho's head of engineering, who shared fascinating insights about building banking infrastructure that actually works at scale. His team's approach to handling reconciliation edge cases was particularly enlightening.

## The Food (Because Details Matter)

Angler lived up to its reputation. The tasting menu was a journey through British seafood excellence:
- The Cornish crab with brown butter and apple was a revelation
- The roasted John Dory with coastal herbs transported me to the seaside
- The dark chocolate soufflé with salted caramel ice cream was the perfect ending

But honestly, the food, excellent as it was, became the backdrop to the conversations.

## Key Takeaways

Three insights from the evening that keep resonating:

1. **Financial operations are becoming a competitive advantage, not just a necessity.** The companies winning aren't just building great products; they're building great financial infrastructure from day one.

2. **The intersection of AI and finance is just getting started.** Every conversation somehow touched on how machine learning is transforming everything from expense management to cash flow forecasting.

3. **The best networking happens when there's no agenda.** The most valuable connections I made were during organic conversations, not structured introductions.

## The Unexpected Moment

The evening's highlight came when Marcus pulled out his laptop to show his prototype, and within minutes, half the table was crowded around, offering suggestions and making introductions to potential customers. It was startup collaboration at its finest – spontaneous, generous, and energizing.

## Looking Forward

As I walked back through the City's empty streets, I couldn't help but feel energized. Events like these remind me why I love the tech community. It's not just about the products we build or the companies we create; it's about the ecosystem of brilliant, passionate people pushing boundaries together.

Thank you to the Rho team for curating such a thoughtful evening. For those building in the finance space, Rho is definitely worth a conversation. But more importantly, they understand that building great products is as much about community as it is about code.

If you were there and I missed connecting with you, please reach out. And if you weren't but are working on something interesting at the intersection of finance and technology, I'd love to hear about it.

Until the next dinner,

*P.S. - Angler's wine pairing deserves its own post. The sommelier's choice of a 2019 Chablis Premier Cru with the shellfish course was perfection.*
