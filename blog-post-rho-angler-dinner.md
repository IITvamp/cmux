# Connections Made at Sea: My Experience at the Rho-Sponsored Angler Dinner

Last night, I had the incredible opportunity to attend an angler dinner sponsored by Rho, and it turned out to be one of those evenings where the conversations were just as memorable as the catch of the day on the menu.

## An Unexpected Gathering

When I first received the invitation, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a fintech company sponsoring an angler-focused event. But as soon as I walked into the venue—a beautifully restored waterfront space with exposed brick and nautical touches—it became clear that this wasn't your typical tech networking event.

The room was filled with an eclectic mix of people: startup founders who fish before their morning standups, VCs who tie their own flies, engineers who debug code by day and chase stripers by night, and even a few professional guides who've pivoted into tech careers. It was refreshing to be in a space where people could geek out about both API endpoints and fishing endpoints.

## The Rho Connection

Rho's presence felt natural rather than forced. Their team clearly understood that some of the best business relationships are built over shared passions rather than forced networking. Their CEO shared a brief story about how some of their best product insights came during early morning fishing trips, where the quiet moments on the water provided clarity that no boardroom could match.

What struck me most was how they've built fishing into their company culture—organizing quarterly fishing trips for the team and even having a Slack channel dedicated to sharing fishing reports and photos. It's a reminder that building a strong company culture often means embracing what makes your team unique.

## Meeting Remarkable People

The dinner introduced me to some fascinating individuals:

- **Sarah**, a former Goldman Sachs analyst who left Wall Street to start a sustainable fishing gear company. She's now building IoT sensors for commercial fishing vessels to reduce bycatch.

- **Marcus**, a full-stack developer who moonlights as a fly fishing guide in the Catskills. He's working on an app that uses machine learning to predict optimal fishing conditions based on historical catch data and weather patterns.

- **Elena**, a venture partner who's investing in "blue economy" startups. She shared insights about the growing intersection of marine conservation and technology.

- **Tom**, a retired software architect who now runs fishing charters and is building an open-source platform for small charter operators to manage bookings and comply with regulations.

## Conversations That Mattered

Over perfectly seared tuna and local oysters, our table's conversation meandered from debating the best knots for fluorocarbon leaders to discussing how blockchain could revolutionize fishing license management. Someone joked that we should start a "Anglers Who Code" meetup, and by the end of the night, we had actually created a Discord server for it.

The most valuable discussion centered around sustainability and technology's role in preserving our waters. Several attendees are working on projects that combine their love of fishing with conservation efforts—from apps that crowdsource water quality data to platforms that connect anglers with local conservation initiatives.

## More Than Just Networking

What made this dinner special wasn't just the networking opportunity—it was the genuine passion everyone brought to the table. In a world of sterile LinkedIn connections and transactional meetups, this felt real. People exchanged not just business cards, but also secret fishing spots (with the appropriate NDAs, of course), hand-tied flies, and promises to meet up on the water.

Rho's sponsorship felt less like corporate marketing and more like a company that genuinely understands its community. They've recognized that some of the most innovative thinkers in tech are also the people who wake up at 4 AM to catch first light on the water.

## Looking Forward

As I left the dinner with a handful of new connections and plans for several fishing trips, I couldn't help but think about how we need more gatherings like this—events that bring together people around shared passions rather than just shared industry verticals.

The evening reminded me that innovation often happens at the intersection of seemingly unrelated interests. Who knows? The next big fintech breakthrough might just come to someone while they're waiting for a bite, watching the sun rise over calm waters.

To Rho, thanks for sponsoring such a unique event. To my new angler friends in tech, I'll see you on the water.
