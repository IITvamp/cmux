# An Evening at Angler: A Rho-Sponsored Tech Dinner That Sparked New Connections

Last week, I had the opportunity to attend an incredible dinner at Angler, the Michelin-starred restaurant in San Francisco, sponsored by Rho. What started as another networking event quickly turned into one of those rare evenings where genuine connections are made and exciting ideas are shared.

## The Setting

Angler, perched on the second floor of a beautifully restored building in the Financial District, provided the perfect backdrop for what would unfold as an intimate gathering of tech professionals. The restaurant's signature wood-fired cooking and panoramic views of the city created an atmosphere that felt both sophisticated and welcoming.

Rho, the modern business banking platform that's been making waves in the fintech space, had curated an interesting mix of attendees. It wasn't your typical startup networking event with endless elevator pitches. Instead, it felt more like a dinner party where everyone happened to work in tech.

## The Conversations

What struck me most about the evening was the diversity of perspectives around the table. We had founders at various stages of their journeys, engineers working on fascinating problems, product managers navigating complex user needs, and even a few investors who shared refreshingly honest takes on the current market.

One conversation that particularly stood out was with a founder working on developer tools - we ended up diving deep into the challenges of building for technical users who have very specific needs and extremely low tolerance for friction. It's the kind of problem space that fascinates me, especially as I work on cmux and think about how to make developer experiences more seamless.

Another memorable discussion centered around the evolution of financial infrastructure for businesses. Having Rho as the host naturally led to conversations about how traditional banking has failed to keep pace with how modern businesses actually operate. The stories shared about expense reporting nightmares and cash flow visibility issues resonated with anyone who's tried to scale a business.

## The Food (Because Let's Be Real)

You can't talk about an evening at Angler without mentioning the food. The tasting menu was exceptional - each course perfectly executed and thoughtfully paired with wines that complemented rather than competed. The wood-fired octopus was a standout, as was the wagyu beef that practically melted off the fork.

But beyond the culinary experience, there's something about sharing a great meal that breaks down barriers. Conversations flow more naturally between courses, and you find yourself discussing ideas you might not share in a typical networking context.

## New Connections

By the end of the evening, I had exchanged contacts with several people I genuinely want to stay in touch with. There's something powerful about meeting people in a relaxed setting where you can have real conversations rather than rapid-fire pitches.

One connection that I'm particularly excited about is with a product manager who's working on infrastructure monitoring tools. We discovered some interesting parallels between what they're building and some of the challenges we face with cmux, particularly around managing multiple development environments and providing visibility into complex systems.

## Reflections

Events like these remind me why I love working in tech. Yes, we're all building products and growing businesses, but at the core, we're a community of people who are genuinely excited about solving problems and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Rho deserves credit not just for their hospitality, but for understanding that meaningful connections happen when you bring interesting people together in a setting where they can actually talk to each other. In a world of increasingly digital interactions, there's still something irreplaceable about sitting around a table, sharing a meal, and having real conversations.

I'm already looking forward to the next opportunity to gather with this group - and hoping that some of the ideas we discussed over dinner might just turn into something more.
